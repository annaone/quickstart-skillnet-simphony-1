*Monitoring Infrastructure* 

You can also use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the AWS Cloud resources the applications you run on AWS. Amazon CloudWatch enables you to monitor your AWS resources in near real-time, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes and Database instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. You can also supply your own logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage, transaction volumes, or error rates, which Amazon CloudWatch will also monitor.

With Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you can set a threshold on metrics and trigger an action when that threshold is exceeded. For example, you can create an alarm that is triggered when the CPU utilization on an EC2 instance crosses a threshold. You can also configure a notification of the event to be sent through SMS or email. Real-time alarms for metrics and events enable you to minimize downtime and potential business impact.
