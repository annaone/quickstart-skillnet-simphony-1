You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the AWS Cloud resources and applications that you run on AWS. CloudWatch lets you monitor your AWS resources in near real-time, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, and database instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. You can also supply your own logs, custom applications, and system metrics (such as memory usage, transaction volumes, and error rates) for CloudWatch to monitor.

With CloudWatch alarms, you can set a threshold on metrics and trigger an action when that threshold is exceeded. For example, you can create an alarm that is triggered when the CPU utilization on an EC2 instance crosses a threshold. You can also configure a notification of the event to be sent through an SMS text message or email. Real-time alarms for metrics and events let you minimize downtime and potential business impact.
